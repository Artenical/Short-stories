PENGUINS
Introduction
POV: You are in science class doing a research project on animals. You think 
“Is there an animal with fur but not a mammal? Or is there an animal that has fur but spiked belly’s? Or can an animal have fur but is not a mammal and has fur but spiked belly’s.” 
Well that animal is a penguin! Some of you will have know idea what that is. But if so, this is the right place for you to learn about them.

	

	
What are Penguins?
	What do penguins eat?
	Penguins usually swim to get food. But I will get into them swimming later. Let’s focus on what they eat. When penguins swim, they catch lots of food like fish. Penguins usually feed on fish because that's the easiest food to catch. And it's the closest food source to them since penguins usually live near an ocean.
	Are they mammals?
	Penguins are NOT mammals. Most people think that because they have fur. But not their full body. I can get more into that later. So even though they have SOME fur it does not mean penguins are mammals. 



Where are Penguins? 

	Where do they live?
	Most people think penguins live in Antarctica and the North Pole. But… they can also  live in North America and South America too. First of all, they can be in zoos. Second, you can also suddenly meet penguins in the ocean. Also they love tropical climates. 
	What is a Penguins Climate?
Since they don't just live in the arctic, their climate isn’t just very cold places. Penguins LOVE tropical climates! It fits their penguin body even though they have a lot of fur. And of course penguins can easily live in cold climates because they have a lot of fur.
